                    <p>Most websites fail not because they look bad, but because they ignore UX. And bad UX is bad business.

That’s where I come in. I’m a Frontend Engineer who combines UI and UX, making me more than just a coder, I’m a UX Engineer. I focus on building websites and apps that people actually enjoy using and keep coming back to.

I believe digital products don’t need endless features to succeed. Clean, thoughtful design and smooth interactions are what make them effective.

Right now, I’m building my own apps:

Nizebook(DocMaete):  helping you save time and study smarter

SnappSort:  turning screenshot chaos into a premium, organized experience


Beyond my projects, I work as a Growth Partner, helping founders and business owners turn ideas into websites, SaaS products, and digital experiences that truly work for their users and get monetized.

If you’re ready to create digital experiences people actually enjoy, check out my feature section and book a call to work with me.

                    <p>Hey Jasmine,

Girl… look at you! Three HNGs down, coding on your phone, building projects, surviving late nights, debugging like a boss and you’re still here, still pushing. Mistakes? Life? All of it happened, but you didn’t give up.

Remember: don’t compare yourself to anyone. Compare today to yesterday. Every small step, every late night grind, every lesson learned from each HNG… it’s building the foundation for something big.

Keep showing up, building in public, learning, and trusting yourself. One day, you’ll look back at these three HNGs and smile, knowing every challenge got you here.

Keep pushing, keep believing, and keep shining. You’ve got this.

Love, JASMINE</p>

                <div class="section-content">
                    <p>Remember, Jasmine: build in public, even when it feels scary, your journey will inspire others just like you’ve been inspired. Burnout is real, so pace yourself, rest when you need to, and don’t forget that small consistent steps matter more than perfection. And never lose your curiosity 
                         explore, experiment, break things, and learn; some of your best ideas will come from the mistakes you make along the way.</p>
